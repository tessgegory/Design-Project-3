        <h2> What is this website about?</h2>
        <p class="text1"> This website is about softball and all of the rules that comes with the sport.
             It will explain the rules, my summer 2022 team, all about my association and a page about me.

        <h3>Why did I choose this topic?</h3>
        <p class="topic"> Softball is one of the sports I play, and it has brought a lot of joy into my life. It’s a sport that I love because I can have fun with my people while doing something that I enjoy. Softball is such a great sport, but not many girls play so this is a great way to show people why I love it and also explain a little bit about it. </p>
        <h4> How did I choose this topic?</h4>
        <p class="howtopic"> I had many options of what I could make my website about, but after recently winning the provincials with my softball team, that was definitely the thing that finalized my decision. I have a lot of love for softball, so I am very glad that I ended up choosing it as a topic, and I hope that the viewers enjoy it as much as I do! Although it wasn’t originally going to be my choice, this is most likely the best subject that I could have created a website about.
